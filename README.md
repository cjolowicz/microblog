# microblog
This is the example project from Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial:

  https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Clone the original here:

This repository is not a clone, but a step-by-step remake as I'm working through this excellent tutorial. There are commits for all the individual steps in each chapter (except for the first three), and tags pointing to the final commit in each chapter. The original repository, by contrast, contains a large commit for every chapter.
