# microblog
This is the example project from Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial:

  https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Clone the original here:

 https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog
 
This is not a clone, but a step-by-step remake as I'm working through this excellent tutorial.

Unlike the original, this repository contains commits for every individual step in each chapter (except for the first three), rather than one large commit per chapter.
