# microblog
This is the example project from Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega Tutorial:

  https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Clone the original here:

 https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog
 
This repository is not a clone, but a step-by-step remake as I'm working through this excellent tutorial. There are separate commits for the individual steps in each chapter (except for the first three). Additionally, the final commit in each chapter is tagged with the chapter number. The original repository, by contrast, contains one large commit for every chapter.
